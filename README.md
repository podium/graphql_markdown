# GraphqlMarkdown

Converts a JSON Graphql Schema to Markdown

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `graphql_markdown` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:graphql_markdown, "~> 0.1.4"}
  ]
end
```

And run:

    $ mix deps.get

    # will create a single file called graphql_schema.md in the current dir
    $ mix graphql_gen_markdown -f ./schema.json


Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/graphql_markdown](https://hexdocs.pm/graphql_markdown).

## Quick Start

You can generate either single page with all the types or a multipage that will then generate separately Mutations, Queries, Enums etc, each in a different file.

### Single page

When you run the following

```shell
mix graphql_gen_markdown -f ./schema.json
```
it will generate the following file in your current folder:

./graphql_schema.md

You can change the default title for the single page with `-t` option.

### Multi pages

When you run the following

```shell
mix graphql_gen_markdown -f ./schema.json -m
```

it will generate the following files in your current folder:

  ./queries.md
  ./mutations.md
  ./objects.md
  ./inputs.md
  ./enums.md
  ./scalars.md
  ./interfaces.md
  ./unions.md
